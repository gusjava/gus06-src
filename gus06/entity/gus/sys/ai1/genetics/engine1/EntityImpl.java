		//3: Select P parents from the current population via proportional selection (i.e.,the selection probability is proportional to the fitness).
		
		//4: Choose at random a pair of parents for mating. Exchange bit strings with the one-point crossover to create two offspring.
		
		//5: Process each offspring by the mutation operator, and insert the resulting offspring in the new population.
		
		//6: Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all parents are selected and mated (P offspring are created).
		
		//7: Replace the old population of chromosomes by the new one.
		
		//8: Evaluate the fitness of each chromosome in the new population.
		
		//9: Go back to step 3 if the number of generations is less than some upper bound. Otherwise, the final result is the best chromosome created during the search.
